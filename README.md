# Bible API

## About
Bible API is a full-stack application providing a RESTful API for Bible data. This project consists of a backend built with Node.js, Express, and TypeORM, a frontend built with Next.js, and a MySQL database. The application is designed for deployment on Vercel.
The backend RESTful API provides endpoints for retrieving books, chapters, and verses of the Bible, as well as a powerful search functionality. The front-end, while still in development, will offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with the data.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeORM
- Database: MySQL
- Frontend: Next.js (in development)
